# RSA-example

This is an example of "plain old RSA" encryption using the Java BigInteger library. DO NOT actually use it for serious encryption, it's insecure in its current state without padding. Feel free to play around with it though.

This repository includes an RSA encryption testing class as well, as well as a messaging server and client that work by having the client send a message encrypted using an RSA function generated by the server. Please feel free to use either as an example of RSA encryption and usage.

To compile all classes, use make. To compile and use the server, use make server. To compile and use the client, use make client. To compile and use the testing class, use make test.

Thanks to:
1. My discrete math class, for getting me interested in RSA encryption in the first place.
2. My programming classes, for getting me interested in messaging between a server and a client.
3. http://doctrina.org/How-RSA-Works-With-Examples.html, which helped explain how RSA works very clearly.
4. StackOverflow, of course.
